## Project 1: Introductory Spatial Analysis

### Overview
This project introduces fundamental concepts of spatial data handling and exploratory spatial analysis. It covers basic operations on spatial data, including visualization, georeferencing, and the analysis of spatial relationships.

### Key Topics
- Spatial data visualization
- Georeferencing and coordinate systems
- Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)
- Identification and analysis of spatial clusters and outliers

### Tools and Libraries
- R
- sf (Simple Features)
- spdep
- ggplot2

## Project 2: Advanced Spatial Econometrics

### Overview
The second assignment deepens the understanding of spatial econometric methods, focusing on econometric modeling techniques applied to spatially referenced economic data.

### Key Topics
- Spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity
- Moran’s I and Geary’s C
- Spatial regression models (Spatial Lag and Spatial Error models)
- Model specification and diagnostics

### Tools and Libraries
- R
- spdep
- spatialreg
- lmtest
- car

### Date Completed
February 4, 2025

## Project 3: Spatial Econometric Modelling

### Overview
The third assignment further advances spatial econometric techniques, focusing on model building, spatial panel data, and advanced diagnostics to assess spatial economic relationships.

### Key Topics
- Spatial panel data econometrics
- Fixed and random effects models in a spatial context
- Advanced spatial diagnostics and interpretation
- Model validation and robustness checks

### Tools and Libraries
- R
- splm (Spatial Panel Data Models)
- plm
- spdep
- spatialreg

### Date Completed
March 3, 2025
